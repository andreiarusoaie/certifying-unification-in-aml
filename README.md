# Certifying (anti)unification in Matching Logic
This repo contains a series of Maude scripts for generating and checking proof certificates for syntactic unification and anti-unification in (Applicative) Matching Logic.

# How to use

**Prerequisites**: [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/), [Maude](http://maude.cs.illinois.edu/w/index.php/Maude_download_and_installation), and [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

**Step 1**: Open a terminal, `cd` into your working dir and type:

```
-$ git clone https://github.com/andreiarusoaie/certifying-unification-in-aml.git
-$ cd certifying-unification-in-aml
```

**Step 2**: Create an input file. Here is an example from our test suite:
```
-$  cat tests/samples/13_paper_cons_succ.in
variables: x1, x2, l1, l2
symbols: cons, succ, zero
problem: cons(succ(x1), cons(zero, l1)) =? cons(x2, cons(succ(x2), l2))
```

The `variables` and `symbols` sections describe the syntax of the input terms. `problem` is the (anti)unification problem to be solved.

**Step 3**: Generate the certificate (anti-unification):
```
-$ python3 ml-antiunify.py tests/samples/13_paper_cons_succ.in
...
```
This will generate the proof and it will also check whether the proof is correct (i.e., certification). The output for this particular call is available [here](https://github.com/andreiarusoaie/certifying-unification-in-aml/blob/master/tests/samples/outputs/11_paper_cons_succ.out).

*Note*: The certificates for unification can be generated by calling the `ml-unify.py` script on the same input:
```
-$ python3 ml-unify.py tests/samples/13_paper_cons_succ.in
```
