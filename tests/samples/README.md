# Samples 

This folder contains several samples, from small trivial examples up to larger examples inspired from real-life K language definitions (C and Java). 
Each sample `*.in` can be passed as an input to our main scripts like this:

* for unification: `python3 ml-unify.py tests/samples/<sample>.in`
* for anti-unification: `python3 ml-antiunify.py tests/samples/<sample>.in`

The outputs for each sample are stored in this repo as well:
* [here](https://github.com/andreiarusoaie/certifying-unification-in-aml/tree/large-examples/tests/samples/outputs/unification) are the outputs for unification
* [here](https://github.com/andreiarusoaie/certifying-unification-in-aml/tree/large-examples/tests/samples/outputs/anti-unification) are the outputs for unification
